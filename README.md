Made by Jani Aalto


Controls:
WASD to move camera, R and F to control height, left shift to move faster, right click to turn camera, escape for pause menu.

Instructions:
The game opens in Setup Phase. Place units on the level until your resource points run out. You can click to select units and check their lines of sight and delete or move them to better positions. Press 'Begin' to start the game. Press 'Open Fire' to make your units start firing on the enemies, revealing the ambush. If an enemy gets too close to one of your units and has a line of sight to it, the ambush is automatically revealed. The enemies will speed for the exit point, and tanks will fight back. You can select a unit and right click on an enemy to force it to fire on it. The level ends when there are no more enemies or friendly units left.
